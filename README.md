# GeoJSON in Go
A simple REST API serving information generated by crunching GeoJSON data of the Indian States. Data used follows GeoJSON standards and can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Subhash9325/GeoJson-Data-of-Indian-States/master/Indian_States)

API provides endpoints for finding the state basis geolocation, ordering states basis direction (east to west and north to south).<br>
Go's GeoJSON package is used to process GeoJSON data - https://github.com/paulmach/orb
